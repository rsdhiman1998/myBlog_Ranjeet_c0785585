                        Mobile phones and devices have become such a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives that itâ€™s difficult to imagine going through an entire day without one. This shift to ubiquity has been driven largely in part by the increasing scope of mobile application development. Over just the past few years an explosion in not just the scope but also the depth of utility of these devices has occurred which rivals, if not exceeds that seen in any other discrete class of technology. 
                        I am a tech geek, So that's why i choose to study Mobile Application development and designing. So that i will able to develop and design high tech mobile apps.
